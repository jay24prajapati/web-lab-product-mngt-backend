# Node.js Backend Tutorials Repository

This repository has the backend code for the Product Management system, built as part of CSCI5709 - Advanced Topics in Web Development. It is the server-side code that works with the Angular frontend, handling things like product data through APIs. This is all related to the tutorial activities for the course.

## Project Overview

All Tutorials Activities:

- Tutorial 1 - Environment Setup (Angular + GitHub)
- Tutorial 2 - Angular SPA â€“ Routing, State Management & Lifecycle Hooks
- Tutorial 3 - Backend Introduction & API Integration (frontend repo link: [https://github.com/jay24prajapati/web-lab-product-management/](https://github.com/jay24prajapati/web-lab-product-management/))
- Tutorial 4 - Angular Forms, Validation & API Integration

It is built with Node.js and Express.js to provide RESTful APIs for the frontend to use.
